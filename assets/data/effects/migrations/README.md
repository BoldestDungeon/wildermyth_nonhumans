# Migrations

The included `migrateHumanAspects.json` effect is used to apply the updated human aspects to characters when this mod is activated in the middle of a campaign.  **DO NOT** make any changes to `migrateHumanAspects.json` directly, as doing so may break compatibility with other mods.

You may use this folder to store any similar effects if you need to update your characters from an old version to a new one if you make significant underlying changes.
