# Effects

Effects are files that tell the game to actually do something in the game - show a comic, make an attack, do something passively behind-the-scenes, etc. Effects are usually associated with one or more `aspects` - if you want a character to be able to make a certain attack, you would add an `aspect` that has the attack as one of its `effects`.

This project includes the following effect types to help get you started:

## Aging

The `aging` effects allow you to have your custom species move through age tiers at a different rate than humans do, and will apply custom age aspects specific to your custom species so that their path through life does not have to match a human's. Feel free to customize the `aging` effect and aspects.

## Migrations

The `migrations` folder includes any effects required to seamlessly upgrade characters from an old version of handling stats to the current version.  Please do not adjust any files included with this project, but feel free to create your own as your own mod evolves.
