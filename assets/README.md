# Assets

This folder contains several sub-folders for important facets used to set up your nonhuman player characters:

* **/animation/spine** Contains the 'skeleton' files that compliment any custom rigs you may want to use. Used to correctly position where the head is drawn on your characters.
* **/data** Contains all of the core game-related data, sorted into several subfolders.
* **/figures** Contains the image files required to render your custom heroes, including sample `.psd` files to help get you started.
* **/text** Contains player-facing text descriptions for certain elements. Best updated using the in-game editor to inspect your `History` and `Aspect` entries.
